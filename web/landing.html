                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p>
                    The rapid transmission of the coronavirus COVID-19 has led to a sudden lack of information of whether or not a user has been in close contact with a COVID-19 case; have they become infected with the virus or have they become a carrier for it? So we decided to make an app that tracks this kind of information anonymously.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h3>What it does </h3>
                <p>
                    It informs you if you have been in close contact with another user who have been diagnosed with the virus to help you get tested early and self-isolate to avoid further spread.</p>
                <p>
                    How does the app know who has the virus? The app uses GPS to record your location data (anonymously), all the data is stored within your device. If a person gets tested positive, they have the option to provide their <u>unique identification number</u> to the health authorities to let the system know that they have tested positive. Again this is anonymous, we have no idea who they were. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system will then capture the infected user location data from the past 2 weeks to use for contact tracing. Users who were in close contact with the infected case will get notifed and be able to view when and where it happened.
                </p>
